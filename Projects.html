      <p><b>An Efficient Polarity Inspection | Jun 2023-Aug 2023</b></p>
      <p>
        • Developed a scalable Machine Learning prediction application on Amazon
        Web Services (AWS) to analyze real-time customer and market feedback
        based on co-occurrence frequencies in tweets, achieving an accuracy of
        80%. • Orchestrated a cloud-based pipeline utilizing Kinesis Data
        Firehose for streaming real-time Twitter data, AWS S3 for data
        ingestion, Sagemaker for real-time modeling, Athena for querying
        results, and Quicksight for data visualization.

          >AWS Website Migration and Security Enhancement | Mar 2023-Jun 2023</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        • Migrated a social science research website from node.js commercial
        hosting to AWS, ensuring enhanced latency, reliability, and high
        availability by employing Amazon ElastiCache for Redis caching, leading
        to a 67% reduction in downtime through regular backups. • Implemented
        robust security measures for the migrated system, including server
        separation, SSL/TLS encryption, restricted access controls using IAM
        policies, and AWS CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and rapid issue
        detection.

      <p><b>Predicting Students performance May | 2022-Aug 2022</b></p>
      <p>
        • Led a team in designing and executing a processing program, utilizing
        and modelling a dataset of 1000 students with various machine learning
        algorithms, data visualization, and clustering, achieving a current
        baseline accuracy value of approximately 93.6%. • Recorded fundamental
        project details, including task progress and analytics, and implemented
        corrective measures, resulting in an average improvement of 15% in
        project performance.
      </p>
      <p><b>Chat application | Apr 2022-Jun 2022</b></p>
      <p>
        • Implemented user-friendly registration with secure authentication,
        designed a responsive interface, created a scalable Node.js backend
        supporting 500+ users, utilized WebSocket for real-time communication,
        and integrated MongoDB for data storage.
      </p>
      <p><b>Stroke prediction system | Jan 2022-Apr 2022</b></p>
      <p>
        • Constructed a Stroke Prediction Machine Learning model in Scala,
        leveraging Random Forest Classification and Gradient-Boosted Tree
        algorithms, achieving an exceptional prediction accuracy of 95.5%. •
        Implemented Apache Spark and Databricks for streamlined processing,
        reducing model training time by 25%. Further enhancements using Python,
        PySpark, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn libraries led to a 30% improvement
        in visualization and model understanding.
